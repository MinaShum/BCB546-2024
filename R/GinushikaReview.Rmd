Overall your assignment work flow was done well, and easy to follow and reproduce.

# Data Inspection and Processing

I have a suggestion for arranging maize and teosinte data in increasing and decreasing order.
You can use the lapply  command instead separating the data one by one and create the data series you need

you can modify the following command to match your files


lapply(unique(file_name$Chromosome), function(chrom_num) {
  maizechrom <- file_name %>% filter(Chromosome == chrom_num) %>% arrange(Position)
  write.table(maizechrom,sep = "\t", file = paste("./desired_directory/maize_increasing", chrom_num, sep = "_"), quote = FALSE)
})



# Data visualization

Your plots look excellent, So I have no suggestion for this section.
I am very impressed with your first plot.


Thanks and good luck!

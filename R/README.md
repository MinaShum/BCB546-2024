## Files in this folder
* `Output_files`: 24 files (chromosome 1:10 + multiple and unknown) for each Maize and Teosinte.
* `Plots_R`: Contains all the plots I got from my script.
* `BCB546_RAssignment`: The main script used to create all the files and plots. (+ output in html)
* Rest are input files.
* These file names are the reviews I recieved: "R_assignment_review_DTB.qmd"and "GinushikaReview.Rmd"

Please simply clone the repository and run the code in the same folder. The input files need to be in the same folder as the script.
